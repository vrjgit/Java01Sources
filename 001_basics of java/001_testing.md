If your goal is to **truly master Manual Testing (not just basics)**, here’s a **realistic and honest timeline**, based on how the industry works and your background 👇

---

## Short Answer

**2–3 months** → Job-ready manual tester
**4–6 months** → Strong / confident manual tester (interview-proof)
**6+ months** → Manual + domain depth (banking, e-commerce, APIs, Agile)

This assumes **1.5–2 hours of focused practice daily**.

## What “Mastering Manual Testing” Actually Means

You’re not “mastered” just by knowing definitions. You’re mastered when you can:

* Understand **requirements & business logic**
* Write **high-quality test cases**
* Find **real production-level bugs**
* Ask the **right questions** to developers & product owners
* Handle **interview scenarios & live test exercises**
* Work comfortably in **Agile/Scrum teams**

---

## Phase-wise Timeline

### 🔹 Phase 1: Fundamentals (2–3 weeks)

You learn:

* SDLC vs STLC
* Types of testing (Smoke, Sanity, Regression, UAT)
* Test case vs Test scenario
* Bug life cycle & severity vs priority
* Black box testing concepts

👉 After this phase:
You **understand testing language**

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Core Manual Testing Skills (4–6 weeks)

This is the MOST IMPORTANT phase.

You practice:

* Writing **test cases from real requirements**
* **Positive & negative testing**
* Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
* Equivalence Partitioning
* Decision tables
* Exploratory testing
* Writing **clear bug reports**

👉 After this phase:
You can **test any basic application confidently**

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Real-World & Interview Readiness (3–4 weeks)

You learn:

* Testing real websites (login, payments, dashboards)
* Agile & Scrum ceremonies
* Test estimation
* Test metrics
* Interview questions & mock scenarios
* “Test this pen / elevator / ATM” questions

👉 After this phase:
You are **job-ready**

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Advanced Confidence (Optional – 1–2 months)

To truly stand out:

* Domain knowledge (Banking / E-commerce)
* API basics (Postman – even for manual testers)
* SQL basics (SELECT queries)
* Jira / TestRail usage
* Automation awareness (not coding, just concepts)

👉 After this phase:
You’re **hard to reject in interviews**

---

## Based on *You Specifically*

You already:

* Work in a **process-driven environment**
* Handle **tools, compliance & workflows**
* Are aiming to **switch to technical roles**

👉 You can realistically reach **job-ready manual tester level in 8–10 weeks** if consistent.

---

## Truth You Should Know (Important)

❌ Manual testing **alone** has limited long-term growth
✅ Manual testing + **API / SQL / Automation awareness** = career safety

Manual testing is the **entry gate**, not the final destination.

## Want a Clear Next Step?

I can:

1. Create a **60-day daily manual testing roadmap**
2. Give **real projects to practice**
3. Provide **interview questions with answers**
4. Show **how to transition from manual → automation later**

Just tell me 👉 **“Yes, give me the roadmap”**
